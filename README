An example of a WS written in java using WS-Addresing to answer Asynchronously.

I writed it to use on my master thesis and it is made to run especific programs. So it won work as it is to everyone, sorry :/
But its code can be changed to run watever you want.

Hope you enjoy it :)

TODO:
Fork the project to a realy basic sample that anyone can use!
